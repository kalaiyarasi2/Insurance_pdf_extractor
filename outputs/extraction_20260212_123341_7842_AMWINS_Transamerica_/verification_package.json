To the extent I have enrolled in preauthorized checking, I understand that the addition or\nremoval of a dependent will impact the amount withdrawn, and hereby consent to such change. I understand that\nAmwins will confirm the new preauthorized amount, but depending on when I submit this request, such confirmation\nmay occur after the amounts are withdrawn from my account. If my account is erroneously charged, my financial\ninstitution will immediately credit the same amount to the account up to the 15 days following issuance of the\nstatement or 45 days after posting, which occurs first.\nDate: Signed:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n          PLEASE DETACH AND RETURN THIS PORTION WITH YOUR PAYMENT.
